This is a recursion code that was supposed to verify the steps in order and step 3 was to call itself after the frist 2 step requirments were met.

This is a decipher type of code that was made in class with my peers. I did not do this alone. it was to make random number/letters mean something even if it was jumbled up. So you could make a secret code and cipher it!

This was  trivia game we made in class with my peers and its just as it sounds. We had fun questions with marvel and other things to see if anyone could guess!
